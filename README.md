## A Note on TypeScript

> I told TypeScript it was just a phase, but now it's checking my types and I can't get rid of it. Send help... or better type definitions!

## Motivation

Remember, every great JavaScript developer started somewhere. Keep improving, keep building, and most importantly, keep debugging those "undefined is not a function" errors!
