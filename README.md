# Genie ðŸ§ž

Welcome to Genie - where your wishes are our commands, but with fewer magical lamps and more JavaScript errors!

## About This Project

Genie is a revolutionary "startup" that promises to solve all your problems with the power of AI. Or at least that's what our investors think we do. In reality, we're just a bunch of developers who enjoy making computers do cool things while we drink coffee and debate tabs vs. spaces.

Our mission is simple: to create an application so intuitive that even your technologically-challenged relatives can use it without calling you for help. (Results may vary. We are not responsible for any holiday dinner tech support you may still be required to provide.)

## Technical Stack

Genie is built using the following technologies:

- **Next.js**: For when React just isn't complicated enough
- **Tailwind CSS**: Because writing actual CSS is so 2010
- **TypeScript**: JavaScript, but with more squiggly red lines
- **Jest & React Testing Library**: For testing all the things we never break (ha!)
- **Prettier & ESLint**: To automatically win all code style arguments

## Getting Started
