# Next.js Application

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Project Structure

- `__tests__/` - Contains test files for the application
- `components/` - Reusable UI components
- `hooks/` - Custom React hooks
- `lib/` - Utility functions and shared logic
- `pages/` - Application routes and API endpoints
- `public/` - Static assets like images and fonts
- `styles/` - CSS and styling files

## Testing

This project uses Jest for testing. Run the tests with:

```bash
npm test
# or
yarn test
```

## Building for Production

Build the application for production:

```bash
npm run build
# or
yarn build
# or
pnpm build
```

To generate static files for deployment:

```bash
npm run export
# or
yarn export
```

This will create an `out` directory with your application's static files.
